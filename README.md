# Project: Predicting Sleep Variables in Mammals

## Overview
The "Predicting Sleep Variables in Mammals" project is designed to leverage machine learning methodologies to predict various sleep attributes, such as total sleep time and dream duration, based on an array of mammalian characteristics. By analyzing a dataset featuring 87 distinct mammals, our research investigates how different factors—like body weight, brain size, dietary habits, and exposure to predation—correlate with and potentially influence sleep patterns. Our ultimate objective is to uncover deeper insights into the biological and ecological aspects of mammalian sleep.

## Repository Contents

- **sleep_merged.csv**: This CSV file is a comprehensive database containing sleep study data for 87 mammals. It includes critical parameters such as TotalSleep, Dreaming, and LifeSpan, which are vital for our in-depth analysis of sleep patterns.

- **Requirements.txt**: This document itemizes all necessary dependencies required to configure the project environment properly. It enumerates each library and its specified version, ensuring the project's seamless functionality.

- **ML_project.ipynb**: Our central Jupyter notebook encompasses the entirety of the machine learning project, detailing every step from initial data analysis to final model evaluation. It includes all code segments, algorithms, data visualizations, and commentary, offering a thorough narrative of our research process.

- **Project_Description_ML_Sleep_2023.docx**: Provided by our supervising faculty, this file delineates the project's objectives, scope, expected deliverables, and specific guidelines, framing the overarching goals and expectations for our study.

- **References**: This directory consolidates all reference materials that have informed and supported our research. It encompasses academic publications, relevant datasets, articles, and additional resources that have been instrumental in our project's development.

## Setup and Installation

Before diving into the `ML_project.ipynb` notebook, it is crucial to have a supportive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can handle Jupyter notebooks. For those without a preferred IDE, we recommend using JupyterLab or Visual Studio Code, supplemented with necessary Jupyter extensions.

### Installing Dependencies

After setting up your IDE, proceed to install the project's dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
